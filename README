  II. Installation and update

    The installation works as described[1] on DokuWiki.org. Summary:

    - If possible, use DokuWiki's plugin manager to install the plugin. Have a
      look at the plugin website[2] to get the package download URL, paste it
      into your Plugin Manager URL box and hit "Download".

    - If you have to install the plugin manually: Download the package from the
      plugin website[2]. Extract it into your DokuWiki's "lib/plugins/" folder.
      Make sure the new directory is named "metaheaders" (rename it if needed).

    Updating the plugin works the same way: Simply install the newest version
    over the existing one. If you got any problems, remove the plugin and
    re-install it. The configuration file holding your data and the plugin
    itself are stored separately. This means you can remove, update or
    re-install this plugin without loosing your MetaHeaders config data.
