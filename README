PLEASE NOTE: I am NO native English speaker. If you find any errors please let
             me know (e.g. by mail). Otherwise, my English is not getting better
             (as desired by myself). Thank you! -- Andreas Haerter



I. Installing the plugin
  The installation is simple and works as described on
  <http://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin_installation_instructions>:

  - Use DokuWiki's plugin manager to install the plugin. You can find the needed
    download URL on <http://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:metaheaders>.

  - If you need to install the plugin manually instead (for whatever reason):
    Download the plugin archive (you can find the needed download URL at
    <http://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:metaheaders>). Extract it into your
    DokuWiki's "lib/plugins/" folder. Make sure the new directory is named
    "metaheaders". Rename it if needed.


II. Usage
  Have a look at <http://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:metaheaders> for usage
  instructions, examples and stuff.


III. Other notes
  - Even if it is not required: If you like the plugin, think about a small
    donation (see <http://andreas-haerter.com/donate/dokuwiki-plugin-metaheaders>)
    and/or a link to <http://andreas-haerter.com/projects/dokuwiki-plugin-metaheaders>.
    Thanks :-).

  - This plugin follows the DokuWiki coding style (see
    <http://www.dokuwiki.org/devel:coding_style>). If you want to submit any
    patches, please respect its rules (even if you don't like it - I also don't
    love it but this simply does not matter).

  - Feel free to send patches or suggestions via mail (or post on
    <http://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:metaheaders>).
